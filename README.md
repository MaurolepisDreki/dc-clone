A trivial clone of GNU/dc for my portfolio, created for my CS1400 course as a 
free-range project that I "worked on this week" (in C#).

This was a random draw considering that I've been focusing on my Web Framework 
in PHP and also learning COBOL, and also that I'd never choose to work in C# 
of my own volition; it was my first language, but (Pure) C/C++ (without 
"modules" and such miscellaneous backwash) is prettier.

One may notice that this code does not make use of classes: CS1400 doesn't 
cover OOP, so I'm trying to keep it relevant to the course.
